Classifying Iris Plant Species
==============================

The famous iris dataset is a traditional statistics demonstration
dataset for building classification models. It contains data for 3
different classes (species) of iris (Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica)
with 50 observations of each class. Each observation records the
flower's petal length and width and the sepal length and width, together
with the known class. The goal is to build a classification model to
classify new observations of flowers.

A classification (decision) tree model to represent the discovered
knowledge is built using a recursive partitioning algorithm. Decision
trees are recognised as an easily understandable representation of the
discovered knowledge. They are widely popular in situations where
insight and explanations are important.

Usage
-----

To install and run the pre-built model:

    $ pip install mlhub
    $ ml install iris
    $ ml configure iris
    $ ml demo iris
    $ ml print iris
    $ ml display iris
